# Nier Automata Interface

## Technologies
HTML5 | CSS3 | JavaScript | React

## Scope
### What it was designed to do
+ Have some fun re-creating the menu interface of one of the best hack and slash games out there.
+ Attempt a more webpage like navigation for what is essentially a controller based interface on the PlayStation 4

## Project Outline & Todos
- Map - main complexity is map which just gets a bit bigger. It slides over the header which also slides upward
- Quests - just lists and panels
- Items - just lists and panels
- Weapons - selecting all weapons generates list, list has info panel. Weapon sets are a bit more tricky
- Skills - just lists of chips that highlight the ones selected on the column. The column could be a flexbox thing by just using `flex: n`.
- Intel - just lists and nested views
- System - just lists and nested views, most with the slimmer header

Todo:
* Navitems, transition state moving from active to focused
* Navitem and menulist, onblur transition for the fill is different from onfocus, might be different if item is initially focused
