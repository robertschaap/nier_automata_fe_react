# Nier Automata Interface

Map - main complexity is map which just gets a bit bigger. It slides over the header which also slides upward
Quests - just lists and panels
Items - just lists and panels
Weapons - selecting all weapons generates list, list has info panel. Weapon sets are a bit more tricky
Skills - just lists of chips that highlight the ones selected on the column. The column could be a flexbox thing by just using `flex: n`.
Intel - just lists and nested views
System - just lists and nested views, most with the slimmer header
